# BUNQSY Finance

**An always-on AI financial guardian for bunq users.**

Built for bunq Hackathon 7.0. BUNQSY doesn't wait for prompts — it monitors your accounts in real time, detects risk and behavioural patterns using a multi-agent Risk Oracle, acts before damage is done, and consolidates knowledge while you sleep via Dream Mode.

## Architecture

TypeScript monorepo managed with Turborepo:

```
packages/
  daemon/     — Fastify 5 backend: bunq API, heartbeat, oracle, AI, voice, bookkeeping
  frontend/   — React 18 + Vite 5 dashboard
  shared/     — Zod schemas and TypeScript types shared across packages
scripts/      — Validation, seeding, and demo utilities
```

### Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Node.js 20+, Fastify 5, TypeScript ESM |
| Database | SQLite (better-sqlite3, WAL mode), sqlite-vec for embeddings |
| Frontend | React 18, Vite 5, Recharts |
| bunq API | REST v1, RSA-2048 + SHA-256 request signing |
| AI | Anthropic Claude (Haiku 4.5 oracle/narration, Sonnet 4.5 receipts/bookkeeping) |
| Voice | ElevenLabs scribe_v1 (STT), eleven_turbo_v2_5 (TTS) |
| Embeddings | Ollama + nomic-embed-text (local, optional) |
| Real-time | WebSocket (`@fastify/websocket`) |

## Core systems

### Heartbeat loop
Runs every 60 s (configurable via `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS`):
1. Syncs all monetary accounts and new transactions into SQLite
2. Builds `AccountSummary` for every active account (multi-account intelligence)
3. Computes the BUNQSY Health Score from four weighted components
4. Runs the Risk Oracle — 7 concurrent sub-agents each casting a typed `OracleVote`
5. Dispatches an intervention if the oracle says to act
6. Appends an append-only tick log and score log entry

### BUNQSY Health Score

| Component | Weight | Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Balance | 35% | Runway months vs estimated monthly spend (or salary ratio) |
| Velocity | 25% | Today's spend vs 30-day average daily spend |
| Goals | 25% | Savings goal progress, time-weighted against target dates |
| Upcoming | 15% | Proximity to rent deadline; subscription coverage ratio |

Weights tunable via `SCORE_WEIGHT_*` env vars.

### Risk Oracle — 7 sub-agents

All agents run concurrently. Each has a hard budget of 800 input + 200 output tokens. They cannot call each other and cannot execute writes. They return a typed `OracleVote`.

| Agent | Detects |
|---|---|
| `balance-sentinel` | Low balance, overdraft risk, unusual spend on joint accounts |
| `velocity-analyzer` | Intraday spend spikes (1.5× – 4× historical average) |
| `fraud-shadow` | Anomalous transaction patterns (LLM-backed) |
| `subscription-watcher` | New recurring charges, cost creep, salary ratio |
| `rent-proximity-guard` | Upcoming rent deadline vs current balance |
| `pattern-matcher` | Vector (Ollama) or SQL matching against learned patterns |
| `jar-optimizer` | Savings jar rebalancing opportunities |

An intervention fires when `shouldIntervene = true` on any vote **and** aggregate risk ≥ 50.

### Single write gateway
**`packages/daemon/src/bunq/execute.ts` is the only file permitted to make POST/PUT/DELETE requests to the bunq API.** All writes flow through `createExecutionPlan → confirmPlan → executePlan`. Every other module is read-only with respect to bunq. Explicit user confirmation (UI tap or voice "yes") is required before `executePlan` is called.

Supported plan step types: `PAYMENT`, `SAVINGS_TRANSFER`, `DRAFT_PAYMENT`, `CANCEL_DRAFT`, `SANDBOX_FUND`, `CARD_FREEZE`, `CARD_UNFREEZE`, `CREATE_SAVINGS_GOAL`.

### Dream Mode
Runs nightly at 02:00 in the user's configured timezone. Executes in a **forked child process** with a 10-minute kill timeout. The worker analyses transaction history, updates pattern confidence scores, generates a DNA card (financial personality snapshot), and produces three actionable suggestions. The worker cannot import `execute.ts`.

### Voice interface
- **STT**: ElevenLabs `scribe_v1` — audio upload via `POST /api/voice`
- **NLU**: Claude Haiku converts transcript to a typed `ExecutionPlan`
- **TTS**: ElevenLabs `eleven_turbo_v2_5` via `POST /api/voice/speak`
- Voice ID configurable via `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` (default: Sarah)

### Cards management
`GET /api/cards` returns live bunq card data (physical + virtual Mastercards). Freeze and unfreeze actions use the PLAN → CONFIRM → EXECUTE gateway with a Claude-narrated confirmation panel. In sandbox mode, realistic demo cards are injected automatically with the real account holder name. `GET /api/bunq-goals` returns native bunq savings goals with progress.

### Bookkeeping
Auto-categorises every synced transaction into a double-entry journal using Claude Haiku. Produces P&L by date range, tax summary by year, VAT period tracking (Dutch quarterly), and exports to CSV and MT940 bank statement format. A review queue surfaces low-confidence categorisations for manual approval.

### 30-day forecast
`GET /api/forecast` generates a day-by-day balance projection. Results cached 6 hours. The engine factors in salary, rent, recurring subscriptions, and impulse spend derived from pattern confidence scores.

### Receipt scanner
`POST /api/receipt` accepts a photo. Claude Sonnet extracts line items, a verifier checks totals within ±2%, a categoriser matches the receipt to a stored transaction, and generates a spending insight.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- bunq sandbox API key — [bunq.com/en/developer](https://www.bunq.com/en/developer)
- Anthropic API key
- ElevenLabs API key (voice features)
- Ollama running locally (optional — vector pattern matching)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <repo-url>
cd KairosFinance
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — fill in BUNQ_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, ELEVENLABS_API_KEY

# 3. Validate bunq sandbox connection (required before anything else)
npx tsx scripts/validate-phase-0.ts

# 4. Launch
bash scripts/start-demo.sh
```

The start script validates `.env`, kills stale processes on ports 3001/5173, starts the daemon, waits for `/api/score` to respond, starts Vite, and opens `http://localhost:5173`.

### Manual start

```bash
# Terminal 1 — daemon (auto-reloads on save)
cd packages/daemon && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd packages/frontend && npm run dev
```

### Pre-demo checklist

```bash
npx tsx scripts/checklist.ts
```

Checks env vars, critical files, SQLite tables, RSA signing round-trip, live daemon health, and script inventory.

## Constitutional rules

Enforced architecturally — cannot be overridden at runtime:

1. **Plan-before-act** — No bunq write without a confirmed `ExecutionPlan` and explicit user approval
2. **Single write gateway** — Only `execute.ts` makes POST/PUT/DELETE to bunq
3. **Bounded sub-agents** — 800 input + 200 output token hard budget per oracle agent; no agent-to-agent calls
4. **Append-only logs** — `tick_log`, `score_log`, `interventions`, `execution_plans` are INSERT-only
5. **Strict TypeScript** — No `any`; all external data validated with Zod before use
6. **Worker isolation** — Dream Mode runs in a forked process with a 10-min kill timeout; cannot import `execute.ts`
7. **Explainability** — Every intervention card includes a plain-English Claude narration

---

## Scripts

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bash scripts/start-demo.sh` | One-command launch (daemon + frontend) |
| `npx tsx scripts/checklist.ts` | Pre-demo validation |
| `npx tsx scripts/validate-phase-0.ts` | Confirm bunq sandbox session |
| `npx tsx scripts/reset-demo.ts` | Wipe database for a clean demo |
| `npx tsx scripts/seed-demo.ts` | Seed realistic transaction history |

---

## bunq integration

- **Authentication**: 3-step protocol — installation (RSA key exchange) → device-server → session creation
- **Session persistence**: Sessions stored in SQLite; restored on restart with a 5-minute expiry buffer
- **Request signing**: Every API call signed with RSA-2048 + SHA-256 per bunq spec
- **Webhook push**: Registers PAYMENT + MUTATION notification filters when `WEBHOOK_PUBLIC_URL` is set
- **Cards API**: Live card data with freeze/unfreeze write support
- **Savings Goals API**: Native bunq goals fetched per monetary account
- **Sandbox demo**: When `BUNQ_ENV=sandbox` and no cards are provisioned, realistic demo cards are injected using the real account holder name
- **Environment selection**: All endpoint logic driven by `BUNQ_ENV` — no hardcoded assumptions

To switch to production: set `BUNQ_ENV=production` with a production `BUNQ_API_KEY`.
